********************** NP Hard And NP Complete Discussion ************************

Polynomial Time Algorithms :
	Binary Search		  - log n
	Linear Search		  - n
	Insertion Sort		  - n^2
	Merge Sort 			  - n logn
	Matrix Multiplication - n^3
	
Exponential Time Algorithms :
	0/1 Knapsack		  - 2^n
	Traveling SP		  - 2^n
	Sum of Subsets		  - 2^n
	Graph Coloring		  - 2^n
	Hamiltonian Cycle	  - 2^n
	
NP Hard And NP Complete is a set of guidelines or framework which is used to solve an exponential time problems to polynomial time problems.

Two important points are as follows :
1. When we are not able to write polynomial time deterministic algorithms for a problem, we should try to write polynomial time non-deterministic algorithms for it.

	There are two types of algorithms.

	1. Deterministic Algorithms : These are those type of algoritms for which we know each and every step clearly.
	2. Non-deterministic Algorithms : These are those algorithms for which, for every step we are not sure, how it is working. It is a combination of deterministic  and non-deterministic steps. Non-deterministic steps are written in the hope, that someday, we will crack it in the near future and the non-deterministic steps are always considered to be O(1).


	Algorithm : NSearch(A, n , key) {
		j = choice();			- Non-deterministic : O(1)
		if (key == A[j]) {
			write(j);
			success();			- Non-deterministic	: O(1)
		}
		
		write(0);
		failure();				- Non-deterministic : O(1)
				
	}

	Classes :

	1. P 	- Set of Deterministic Algorithms with polynomial time solutions i.e Linear Search , Binary Search
	2. NP	- Set of non-deterministic algorithms with polynomial time solutions. It means currently we don't know it but in the near future, we'll know this. Ex - 	    All  exponential time algorithms mentioned above .

2. When we are unable to find the solution for the exponential problems in polynomial time, then, at least , we should try to find the similarity between all the  exponentials problems such that if one problem is solved, all other problem is solved.

The base problem is satisfiablity problem. Plz find the picture attached in the repository.

# NOTE : NP Hard Problems are those problems for which we want to have a polynomial time solutions but we don't even have any non-deterministic solutions for it.
